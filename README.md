# Project Codewars - Data operations

## Story

In this project, the goal is to challenge your knowledge in data operations on Codewars.

> In this project, we ask you to solve these exercises on Codewars, but insert your solution here.
>
> By inserting your solution, you can easily check your peers' solution on reviews, by running *tests*.
>
> Speaking about tests! You can find a *class* named like *Test<kata-name>* and some other seemingly odd and new code snippets.
> These are ONLY there to help you check your solution, you don't need to worry about them!

## What are you going to learn?

- data operations
- solve algorithmic challenges

    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

2. Train on the challenge [Double Every Other](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5809c661f15835266900010a) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `double-every-other.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

3. Train on the challenge [Swap items in a dictionary](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a21e090f28b824def00013c) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `swap-items.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

4. Train on the challenge [Sum of a nested list](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a15a4db06d5b6d33c000018) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `sum-of-a-lists.py` file.
    - There is a solution submitted on Codewars.
    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

5. Train on the challenge [Nested List Depth](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56b3b9c7a6df24cf8c00000e) on Codewars.
    - There is a solution inserted in the `nested-lists.py` file.

    - There is a succesful solution submitted, where all tests pass.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can test your solution of the `Filter the number` kata after inserting your solution in `filter-the-number.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest filter-the-number.TestFilterTheNumber.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Double every other` kata after inserting your solution in `double-every-other.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest double-every-other.TestDoubleEveryOther.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Swap items in a dictionary` kata after inserting your solution in `swap-items.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest swap-items.TestSwitchDict.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Sum of a nested list` kata after inserting your solution in `sum-of-a-lists.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest sum-of-a-lists.TestSumNested.test_basics`
- You can test your solution of the `Nested List Depth` kata after inserting your solution in `nested-lists.py` by running the following: `python -m unittest nested-lists.TestListDepth.test_basics`
